      <h2>1. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings
        or by contacting us at <strong>support@remindflow.in</strong>.
        Cancellation will prevent future renewals but does not automatically
        entitle you to a refund for the current billing period.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
      <p>Refunds are considered only under the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An incorrect or duplicate charge due to a billing error.</li>
        <li>
          Payment was successful but paid features were not activated due to a
          technical issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exceptional cases reviewed at our sole discretion, reported within
          <strong>24 hours</strong> of the transaction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Change of mind after purchase.</li>
        <li>Dissatisfaction due to expected product behaviour or outcomes.</li>
        <li>Partial usage of the Service during an active billing cycle.</li>
        <li>Expiry or completion of a free trial period.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Refund Process & Timeline</h2>
      <p>
        If a refund request is approved, the refund will be initiated within
        <strong>3–7 business days</strong>. The time taken for the amount to
        reflect in your account depends on your bank or payment provider.
      </p>

      <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>

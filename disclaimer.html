      <p>
        RemindFlow is a payment management and follow-up assistance system
        designed to help professionals track invoices and send structured
        payment reminders. While we aim to improve payment follow-ups, we do not
        guarantee successful payment recovery.
      </p>

      <h2>No Legal or Financial Advice</h2>
      <p>
        RemindFlow does not provide legal, financial, or debt-collection
        services. Any actions taken based on information or tools provided by
        the Service are solely at your discretion and risk.
      </p>

      <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for the accuracy of invoices, client details,
        reminder content, and compliance with applicable laws. RemindFlow is not
        responsible for disputes, delayed payments, or non-payments between you
        and your clients.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may rely on third-party platforms such as payment gateways,
        email providers, or messaging services. RemindFlow is not responsible
        for failures, delays, or errors caused by third-party systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation</h2>
      <p>
        By using RemindFlow, you acknowledge that payment outcomes depend on
        client behaviour and external factors beyond our control.
      </p>
